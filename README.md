# Word-Counter
This is a script to count how many different words can be found in a .txt files. I wanted to have fun and try to see how many different words are needed to write a book.
It does take into account proper noun though, so it might not be 100% accurate.

Launch the script and then it will ask you for the explorer adress of your .txt file. Write it (or copy / paste it) and it will tell you how many different words are in the text.

There is a version written by myself and a version corrected by ChatGPT, which is much faster.
